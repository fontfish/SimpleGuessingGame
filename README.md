# SimpleGuessingGame
A very simple guessing game in Python3.

Made as a test of some of the concepts explained in this course:
https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/video-game-design-development

I'm sure there's a similar guessing game to this in an introduction to Python
I've read somewhere, but I did write this one from scratch.
(The class definition is based on the one in the above-linked course, though!)
